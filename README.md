Course Description: You will learn to use the R data analysis software package to complete data processing, analyses, and graphing. This 1-credit course is for anyone who would like to start or enhance their ability to do so accurately and efficiently. Although this is generally an introductory course, those of you who are familiar with R will learn how data, functions, and analysis output are structured so you can have the tools to run complex analyses. The advantage of R over other software packages is you will have a record of your processing and analyses that you can replicate without effort. In addition, R is and will always be free!
