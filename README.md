Course Description: You will learn to use the R data analysis software package to complete data processing, analyses, and graphing. This 1-credit course is for anyone who would like to start or enhance their ability to do so accurately and efficiently. Although this is generally an introductory course, those of you who are familiar with R will learn how data, functions, and analysis output are structured so you can have the tools to run complex analyses. The advantage of R over other software packages is you will have a record of your processing and analyses that you can replicate without effort. In addition, R is and will always be free!Class Schedule:September 1st:Topics•	Course overview•	Pre-course survey•	Introduction to R and swirlSeptember 8th:Topics•	Vectors•	Data frames•	Subsetting data Helpful websites•	http://www.statmethods.net/management/subset.html •	http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/modules/subsetting.htm September 15th:Topics•	Importing data into R•	Object typesHelpful websites•	http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/inputdata_R.htm September 22nd:Topics•	If else statements•	for loopsHelpful websites•	http://www.programiz.com/r-programming/if-else-statement September 29th: Topics•	Summary statistics/Central Tendencies•	Handling missing dataHelpful websites•	Under the infix functions section - http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html•	Writing your own functions - http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/library/intro_function.htm October 6th:Topics•	Basic statistical analyses•	T tests, correlationsHelpful websites•	http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/r-t-tests October 13th:Topics•	Writing scripts from data processing to summary statistics•	Merging dataOctober 20th:Topics•	Graphing: scatterplot, boxplots, bar plotsOctober 27th:Topics•	Reshape data•	Substitutions and paste functionsHelpful Websites•	http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html November 3rd:Topics•	ANOVAHelpful Websites•	http://www.personality-project.org/r/r.anova.html •	http://yatani.jp/teaching/doku.php?id=hcistats:anova November 10th:Topics•	Linear RegressionNovember 17th:Topics•	Research ScenariosNovember 24th: Topics•	Research ScenariosDecember 1st:Topics•	Your choice!
