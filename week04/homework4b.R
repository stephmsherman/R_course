#the rest of the lesson should be typed in directly to the console

#Once you complete a lesson go to File -> Save As -> [Last Name]_homework4b.txt

#If you are using R studio, copy the contents of the console and paste them into a text file.

#Upload the text file to canvas that contains both Subsetting Vectors and Matrices and Data Frames

#if at any time you need to exit swirl type: bye()
