#Lecture 1 code - introduction

# the hash is used as a comment.  You can use it in the beginning of a line or after an R command

# How to run code from your script:
## Windows: "control R"
## Mac: "command return"
 
# Various methods of defining variables
a = 3 #this assigns the 3 to the variable a
b <- 3 #this assigns the 3 to the variable b

# print results
a
b

#run the line below
#a = 4

#print a
a
#because there is a hash in front of this assignment it will not change a to equal 4
#if you would like to take additional notes please use the hash 

#can use R as a calculator
a+b

#Now try the swirl homework :)
